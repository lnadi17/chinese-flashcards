# Chinese Flashcards

This is the first Java program I created with Swing. I learned how to use the MVC design pattern while working on it,
and the software itself helped me learn during the Chinese course. There are two views for this program, "Data" and "Practice". 
Data view allows the user to add custom words to the database, change or remove them. Practice view shows user all these flashards created 
from these words in random order, until the user correctly answers all of them, after which the program exits.

## Installation

Program needs [Java (JRE)](https://www.java.com/en/download/) to run, no extra installation step is needed. Program release comes with the `res` folder, which contains `data.json`,
 which is a crucial file and program won't run without this. This file contains all the flashcard data the user has. To run the actual program,
  open the `chinese.jar` file from the root of release directory.

## Usage

The program needs some explanation before the user can fully use it.
